Zilean is a Windows app written in Python for **League of Legends**. It is completely free and open source. It is meant for *junglers* who want to improve their jungle clears in Practice Tool.

The app provides an overlay with a timer that makes it easy to measure progress and to identify portions of the clear where there is a loss of efficiency.

Zilean uses the official [Live Client Data API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#league-client-api) and computer vision to read the current creep score.

It also uses [Phylaris' Jungle Clear Compilation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gjk5UrtAbcqdYnRlx9KMDuHGxhKsEv50vhn02cN0y-c/edit#gid=748212425) to get some of the best jungle clear times for each champion.

Thanks to him and all the other players that contributed to it.

You can get the last release [here](https://github.com/j4n7/zilean/releases).

## Why use Zilean?

- Compare your clears in real time with the ones made by pro-players and see where you are not being efficient. New champions and clear times will be added in the future.

- Measure the time it takes to clear each camp individually. This information can help you improve your jungle pathing by knowing in what stages you could perform better.

- You can manually spawn jungle monsters inside the Practice Tool before their default spawning time and the Zilean will adjust the time for you. This way you won't need to wait any time before you can start practicing your desired jungle clear.

***Take into account that it only registers 6 camps at maximum and crabs, drakes, herald and baron are excluded.***



## How to use Zilean?

**This Jungle Path Chronometer is only meant to be used in the Practice Tool.**

Install the last version from [here](https://github.com/j4n7/zilean/releases).

Zilean is only compatible with a **game resolution of 1920x1080**.

Please, first be sure that inside the "Video tab" from the LOL ingame settings you have "Window mode" selected as **"Borderless"** (default) or "Windowed".

Whenever you want to use Zilean, just double click the shortcut icon and it will automatically appear on your Windows System Tray.

If you want to exit from the application, just double click the system tray icon or right click it and select the appropriate option.

To start the timer, the user only needs to press the **backspace key** and Zilean will start as soon as the user inputs an action (uses a skill, moves or attacks).

Is there is an optimized clear for you champion, Zilean will compare your current clear with it in real time. Zilean will tell you how many seconds are left to clear a camp.

Some champions have two optimized clears, depending if they start on red or blue buff. You can change this by right clicking the system tray icon and choosing the appropriate color.
